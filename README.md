# 💸 Expense Splitter App

A simple Flutter app to split expenses among friends.  
You enter the total amount, choose the number of people, and the app calculates how much each person has to pay.  
Optionally, you can include a 10% tip with just a toggle switch. 🎉

## 🎯 Why I built this
I wanted to practice building stateful widgets, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically in Flutter.  
Instead of a big project, I chose something simple and practical that anyone can use while going out with friends.
